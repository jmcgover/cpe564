Paper Title:
Jupiter Rising - A Decade of Clos Topologies and Centralized Control in Googleâ€™s Datacenter Network

Provide a short summary of the paper:
In this paper, Google engineers present yet another aspect of their datacenter, highlighting its progression and design decisions throughout the last decade, 

What are the strengths of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
The paper does an okay job explaining the system. It gives some good insight into _real_ problems that engineers face in production.

What are the weaknesses of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
It lacks specificity and structure in certain parts. It stays jargony throughout the paper. Some tables and figures aren't very useful (but could be).

Overall paper merit (1 [worst] - 10 [best] ):
7

Provide detailed comments (expand on strengths/weaknesses; >= 2 paragraphs):
Overall, this paper is a good resource. Ten years of in production results shows that Jupiter (and it previous iterations) work and scale. IT's great that the paper focuses on some usually overlooked aspects of in production datacenters, like cabling, that motivated their design.

Frequently, as in their other papers, jargony terms like ``merchant silicon'' are thrown around. Certainly, a google search gave me the answer I wanted, but this term feels unclear and industry specific. A single definition for this term would be beneficial to the literature. Simiarly, Clos topologies could use an overview, instead of a silent referral to the paper and a vague notion of what it's useful for.

Table 3 is useless. From a design perspective, it's almost like you should just take it out. Make it three columns, label the columns with variables or something. It's garbage as it is.

Paper Title:
Packet-Level Telemetry in Large Datacenter Networks

Provide a short summary of the paper:
This paper discusses Everflow, a method of packet trace capture and analysis system built on commodity switches that can randomly sample the packets going through a large datacenter network and even play back and trace teh packets again.

What are the strengths of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
Everflow uses commodity switches, making it accessible, only samples the packets, making it scalable and tractable to analyze, and allows playback. Furthermore, the authors implemented the system and tested it.

What are the weaknesses of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
Some clarity on commodity switches would be useful, considering that it seems to be such an integral part ot making Everflow effective. It feels like more justification/validation may be possible. 

Overall paper merit (1 [worst] - 10 [best] ):
7

Provide detailed comments (expand on strengths/weaknesses; >= 2 paragraphs):
Everflow appears to be a very useful system. The case studies seem to show its effectiveness and the level of sampling it provides is useful.

Clarification on ``commodity switches'' appears to be crucial here. Many businesses fall short of enterprise, but may still use enterprise level tools. When does commodity stop being commodity?

Statistical justification of sampling feels possible with Everflow, based on populations and the sampling size. Why wasn't that touched on?

Paper Title:
Fastpass - a centralized zero-queue datacenter network

Provide a short summary of the paper:
This paper presents Fastpass, a decentralized packet queuing and routing system that claims low latency, high throughput, and fair allocation.

What are the strengths of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
The researchers actually test this on a real set of servers and appear to have good results, compared to TCP.

What are the weaknesses of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
It isn't clear what kind of datacenters this is useful for. Experimental results lack clear relevance.

Overall paper merit (1 [worst] - 10 [best] ):
6

Provide detailed comments (expand on strengths/weaknesses; >= 2 paragraphs):
Fastpass appears to be a great algorithm for achieving high throughput and fair packet management. Compared to TCP, the experimental results appear to be more stable and generally better.

It isn't clear, however, what sort of datacenter Fastpass applies to. The experiment setup was a very straightforward web service pipeline, but the nature of which isn't clear and whether Fastpass is good for other types of services also isn't clear.

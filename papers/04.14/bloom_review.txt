Paper Title:
Compressed Bloom Filters

Provide a short summary of the paper:
This paper provide a formal derivation for the effects of using compression on Bloom Filters with respect to passing the compressed filter as a message. The authors frame the derivation in terms of design motivations for the programmer using the algorithm for this purpose, additionally showing the effects of only sending changes in order to further reduce message sizes.

What are the strengths of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
The authors present their proofs and derivations in clear, concise ways --- not taking too big or small of leaps from one equation to the next.

What are the weaknesses of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
It would have been nice to see real-world implementation in order to compare as well as more grounding of its relevance. Minor typos occur throughout.

Overall paper merit (1 [worst] - 10 [best] ):
8

Provide detailed comments (expand on strengths/weaknesses; >= 2 paragraphs):
This was a nice paper to read. Nearly every equation was clear and explained thoroughly without going through unnecessary details. 

More examples of how this interpretation of Bloom Filters applies is desired. The proxy list example is salient enough, but the scale to which the compression helps the proxy list isn't clear, nor is it clear what other problems this could apply to. If there is a generalized type of distributed problem solved by this besides just web cache sharing, mention it.

Minor typos occur. The fourth to last paragraph in Section 2 ``the number of bits each items hashes to'' appears to be a typo. Equation 2 may not be a typo, but it is unclear how log_2(e) shows up on the bottom of that fraction.

Paper Title:
InterTubes - A Study of the US Long-haul Fiber-optic Infrastructure

Provide a short summary of the paper:
Presented in this paper is the methodology of construction of a country-wide map of long haul fiber infrastructure in the United States, an analysis of risk, and proposals on how to improve it using graph building coupled with a cost minimizing algorithm.

What are the strengths of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
The authors present their method mostly in full, use public data sources, and build a reasonable model of risk.

What are the weaknesses of the paper? (1-3 sentences):
Risk models may be seen as simplistic and results gained from implementing them minimal and admittedly infeasible. Clarification of methods would be beneficial.

Overall paper merit (1 [worst] - 10 [best] ):
6

Provide detailed comments (expand on strengths/weaknesses; >= 2 paragraphs):
The researchers who authored did a good job pooling publicly available resources together to building this map. It is encouraging that such data is publicly available and potentially useful inferences can be made from it.

The risk models seem to offer little insight into ways of improving the infrastructure and that may be due to the data available and the nature of the infrastructure. Ultimately, money is a real barrier to breaking the ``dig once'' policy of small carriers and little of that will change, making proposals of that nature impractical and many times irresponsible. 

Clarification on how they validated and merged the maps would demystify the process. How much of it was software? There appears to be some manual googling, but it isn't clear how much data the researchers have to sift through by hand.

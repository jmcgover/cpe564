Paper Title: Congestion Control for High Bandwidth-Delay Product
Provide a short summary of the paper: Treating the network like a control system, the authors of this paper build a congestion control mechanism that adjusts a feedback loop in order to maximize utilization according to parameters determined through simulation. In doing so, they separate bandwidth utilization and fairness and provide a congestion control scheme that can be implemented on a router, is compatible with TCP, and works well with long delay, high bandwidth networks.
What are the strengths of the paper? (1-3 sentences): The authors design a promising congestion control scheme that, while more complex than TCP, does a far better job of utilizing the network. 
What are the weaknesses of the paper? (1-3 sentences): There is little discussion of whether the scheme is widely applicable to consumer networks.
Overall paper merit (1 [worst] - 10 [best] ): 8
Provide detailed comments (expand on strengths/weaknesses; >= 2 paragraphs): XCP appear to be a great potential replacment to TCP. Conveniently, it is also compatible with TCP and appears to be low processing overhead.

Little discussion however happens with regard to how implementable it is for a consumer audience. They talk about satellites and large networks using it, but whether it is good for popular use is unclear.
